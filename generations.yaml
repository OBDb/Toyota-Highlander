generations:
  - name: "First Generation (XU20)"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Highlander pioneered Toyota's car-based midsize crossover segment, based on the Camry platform rather than traditional truck underpinnings. Featuring a unibody construction, front-wheel drive architecture with optional all-wheel drive, and a focus on on-road comfort over off-road capability, the original Highlander represented Toyota's response to growing consumer demand for more car-like SUVs. Available in five or seven-passenger configurations (the latter added mid-generation), the Highlander featured conservative, mainstream styling with a practical, upright profile prioritizing interior space and visibility. Engine options included a 2.4-liter four-cylinder producing 155 horsepower and a 3.0-liter V6 generating 220 horsepower (later upgraded to a 3.3-liter with 230 horsepower), both paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The interior emphasized practicality with straightforward controls, reasonable material quality, and flexible seating arrangements, though without the luxury touches found in its Lexus RX cousin. A mild refresh in 2004 brought updated styling and the optional third row, though the rearmost seats were suitable mainly for children. This generation established the Highlander's reputation for reliability, practicality, and no-fuss ownership experience, appealing to families transitioning from sedans to more versatile vehicles while seeking Toyota's known quality and value."

  - name: "Second Generation (XU40)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Highlander grew substantially in size, emphasizing improved passenger space particularly in the now-standard third row, while adopting more distinctive styling with a prominent grille and more substantial overall presence. Built on an enhanced version of the Camry/Avalon platform, this Highlander offered front-wheel drive standard with optional all-wheel drive, maintaining its car-based crossover approach. Engine options included a base 2.7-liter four-cylinder producing 187 horsepower (new to the lineup) and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 270 horsepower, paired with either a six-speed (I4) or five-speed (V6) automatic transmission. This generation also introduced the Highlander Hybrid, combining the V6 with electric motors for improved efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Interior space expanded significantly, with a clever second-row center seat that could be stowed in a console between the outboard seats or installed to accommodate an eighth passenger. Materials and design improved over the previous generation, with more soft-touch surfaces and available features including a premium JBL audio system, three-zone climate control, and a backup camera on higher trims. A mid-cycle refresh in 2011 brought revised exterior styling with a more aggressive front end and interior refinements. This generation built upon the Highlander's reputation for practical, family-friendly transportation with enhanced space, features, and refinement, further establishing it as a benchmark in the increasingly competitive midsize crossover segment."

  - name: "Third Generation (XU50)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The third-generation Toyota Highlander featured more aggressive, truck-inspired styling with a prominent trapezoidal grille, pronounced fender flares, and a more muscular overall appearance while maintaining its car-based underpinnings. Built on Toyota's revised K platform, this Highlander grew slightly larger again, offering improved interior space particularly for third-row passengers and cargo. Engine options initially carried over, including the 2.7-liter four-cylinder and 3.5-liter V6, though the four-cylinder was discontinued mid-generation as the vast majority of buyers opted for the V6. In 2017, the V6 was paired with a new eight-speed automatic transmission replacing the previous six-speed, while gaining direct injection for improved power (295 horsepower) and efficiency. The Highlander Hybrid continued with its Atkinson-cycle V6 and electric motor combination, now achieving up to 28 mpg combined. Interior quality took another step forward with more premium materials, particularly in higher trim levels, while technology expanded to include features like an 8-inch touchscreen, Driver Easy Speak (using the microphone to amplify the driver's voice to rear passengers), and an expanded suite of safety features including standard Toyota Safety Sense P from 2017 onward. Seating for up to eight passengers was available with a second-row bench, while seven-passenger configurations featured second-row captain's chairs. A refresh in 2017 brought the aforementioned powertrain updates along with revised styling featuring an even larger grille and expanded feature content. This generation further refined the Highlander's position as a practical, feature-rich family vehicle combining SUV versatility with car-like comfort and driving dynamics."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (XU70)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Toyota Highlander represents a comprehensive redesign built on Toyota's TNGA-K platform, featuring more distinctive styling with a mix of sharp character lines and curved surfaces, a more cohesive overall design, and improved proportions including a longer, more SUV-like hood line. Slightly larger than its predecessor at 194.9 inches in length, this Highlander emphasizes improved dynamics and refinement alongside its traditional strengths of practicality and reliability. The standard powertrain is now a 3.5-liter V6 producing 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, with front-wheel drive standard and three different all-wheel drive systems available depending on trim level. A significant change for the 2023 model year replaced the V6 with a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 265 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque. The Highlander Hybrid combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with electric motors for a total system output of 243 horsepower while achieving up to 36 mpg combined with front-wheel driveâ€”a significant efficiency improvement over previous generations. Interior quality reaches new heights with more premium materials throughout, standard three-zone climate control, and enhanced technology including a standard 8-inch or available 12.3-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Safety technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+ standard across all trims, offering features including pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, full-speed dynamic radar cruise control, lane tracing assist, and automatic high beams. Available in L, LE, XLE, XSE, Limited, and Platinum trim levels, the Highlander offers configurations ranging from practical to near-luxury, all sharing the model's focus on family-friendly design with features including seven USB ports throughout the cabin, available second-row captain's chairs, and a power liftgate on most trims. The fourth-generation Highlander builds upon the model's reputation for practical, reliable family transportation while offering enhanced style, efficiency, and technology to maintain its position in the highly competitive midsize crossover segment."
